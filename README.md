# 📝 Flutter Skeleton Loading Demo
This project demonstrates how to implement **skeleton loading screens** in Flutter.  

Skeleton loaders are placeholder UI elements that mimic the structure of your content while data is being fetched. They improve user experience by giving a visual indication that content is loading.

## 🚀 Features
- Skeleton loading UI for banners and products.
- Toggle between skeleton mode and actual content using a FloatingActionButton.
- Clean and simple Flutter code structure.
- Easily extendable to real API calls.
